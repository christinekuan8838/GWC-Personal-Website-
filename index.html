<!-- Interest/Goal #3-->
  
  <h3 id= "Title-mindful">Becoming More Mindful</h3>
<p id = "Description-mindful">
According to many sources, becoming more mindful is a way to relieve stress and enhance health overall. It helps yourself to sway away from compulsions and temptations and to simply focus on yourself. Using this practice has shown me significant benefits for myself, and I definitely want to keep up the routine. <p/>
