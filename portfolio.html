    <h6> Vex Robotics Robot </h6>
    <p class = "para">Last year, I spent a majority of time afterschool co-captaining the Robotics team where we competited our way to the VEX World Championships in Dallas, Texas. This year’s challenge was “Tipping Point, which can be described in this <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8XcvADUXTE" target="_blank">  video</a>, and we were required to design a robot that could maximize the most points within the game. Despite it being difficult to have enough funding to go to Dallas, we did everything we could and had an amazing time there. </p>

    <h6>Miami Clean Connect (MCC) </h6>
    <p class = "para"> This is project was one of the first experiences of coding competitively in the Techtogether Miami Hackathon. I was randomly put into a team and we all instantly clicked. However, we all had diffcult schdules and couldn’t completely finish the project up to our expectations. It was confusing and difficult especially for me, who was still learning the basics of coding in a group of talented coders.  </p>
